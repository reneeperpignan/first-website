          <p class=space>Learning how to code does not need to be limited to the classroom! There are so many resources i wish I knew about to teach yourself how to code for free! I have included some helpful websites and links that I have enjoyed using! The links have all different kinds of resources for learning how to code, and you will have access to information about learning different coding languages, web development, data structures and algorithms, data science, and so much more!</p>
          
          
          
            <h1 class="header1"> Free courses</h1>
                
              <div><a class="header2" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a></div>
              <div class="content">FreeCodeCamp has both a website and a Youtube channel that have incredible courses on everything computer science related. The courses are long, so it's kind of like taking an actual course, but they are usually broken up into sections. This is a great free resource for learning how to code that has levels from beginners to advanced!</div>
              
              <div><a class="header2" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a></div>
              <div class="content">Codeacademy is a website that has free computer science courses! Some courses are free and some you need a subscription, but I think that the free courses they offer are still super helpful! They teach you the content and have you do exercises and projects to retain the content. I recently took a course on introductory Javascript, and I learned so much!</div>
              
              <div><a class="header2" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></div>
              <div class="content">W3Schools is another great resource. Usually when I do a Google search for "How to get x in HTML, CSS, or Javascript, this website link is one of the first to show up. They have so many different examples, and I have benefitted from this website when teaching myself web development!</div>
          
            
            
          <h1 class="header1"> Data structures + Algorithms</h1>
          <div class="content">Data structures and algorithms are imperative for cracking the coding interviews! If you major in computer science, you will take classes on this, but the more practice you get, the better!</div>
          
            <div><a class="header2" href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a></div>
            <div class="content"></div>
              <div class="content">Leetcode is probably the most popular way to practice data structures and algorithms. They have thousands of practice problems with many solutions, and it is a super helpful way to learn how to solve problems efficiently and get better at coding</div>
            <div><a class="header2" href="https://neetcode.io/">Neetcode</a></div>
              <div class="content">This is a website (and Youtube channel) that has been very helpful for me. The website has a set of Leetcode questions called the Blind 75 that is a sort of all-encompassing data structures and algorithms review for if people are pressed for time before their interview or don't know where to start with Leetcode, but I recommend familiarizing yourself with DSA first.</div>
            <div><a class="header2" href="https://youtu.be/8hly31xKli0">Youtube course on DSA</a></div>
              <div class="content">Here is a Youtube course on learning data structures and algorithms. It is super long and not meant for you to absorb all in one day, but doing a little learning each day can go a long way!</div>
